## Here you will find:
- My solutions to the programming assignments.
- My certificates for each of the courses, in pdf format.
- A scan of my handwritten notes.

The specialization emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details, which is why I have ultimately opted to implement solutions to the programming assignments in the course using Python, the language I am most comfortable with.

Attempting to use Java or C would have distracted me from the big picture and undermined my efforts to understand and remember high-level concepts in algorithms and data structures.

## Syllabus

Stanford's Algorithm Specialisation is divided into 4 courses, each covering different topics in algorithms, data structures and dynamic programming

**1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms**
- **Week 1**: Introduction; "big-oh" notation and asymptotic analysis.
- **Week 2**: Divide-and-conquer basics; the master method for analyzing divide and conquer algorithms.
- **Week 3**: The QuickSort algorithm and its analysis; probability review.
- **Week 4**: Linear-time selection; graphs, cuts, and the contraction algorithm.

 **2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures**
- **Week 1**: Breadth-first and depth-first search; computing strong components; applications.
- **Week 2**: Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm.
- **Week 3**: Heaps; balanced binary search trees.
- **Week 4**: Hashing; bloom filters.

 **3. Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming**
 - **Week 1**: Two motivating applications; selected review; introduction to greedy algorithms; a scheduling application; Prim's MST algorithm.
- **Week 2**: Kruskal's MST algorithm and applications to clustering; advanced union-find (optional).
- **Week 3**: Huffman codes; introduction to dynamic programming.
- **Week 4**: Advanced dynamic programming: the knapsack problem, sequence alignment, and optimal binary search trees.

 **4. Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them**
- **Week 1**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm; all-pairs shortest paths.
-  **Week 2**: NP-complete problems and exact algorithms for them.
